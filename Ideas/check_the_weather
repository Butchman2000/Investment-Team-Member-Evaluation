"check the weather"
***Me
In the last two months, we have seen the highest volatility in 130 years, we lost 25% of market value, and the dollar is dropping. 
if a trading system cannot 'look out the window to check the weather (precipitation, wind, danger, storms, falling trees), then it will most certainly fail

I think what you want is a multi-dimensional, adaptive trading model—one that factors in not just signals and technical setups,
but macro context, volatility surfaces, and regime shifts—which is critical in today's markets.

"If two candles with long wicks point down, then buy."
That’s just surface-level. It ignores the deeper forces that actually move the market:...

Options pricing, Volatility conditions, Macro events
, Liquidity dynamics

Just like you'd check for a storm before flying a plane, we checks the "market weather" before making a trade.
- Is volatility high?
- Are options overpriced?
- Is there economic news today?
This tells us if it’s safe to trade — or too risky.

  conceptually, abstractly first. coding is the easy part. we are trying to tackle nailing down those elements you mentioned, 
and the behavior of the underlying equity (stock), and the interplay of the weather with the stock. risk on/risk off is more of
a select gradient of choices (five in that range). but again, the function creation, and coding can be done by so many others. 
  solidfying the idea approach is the main priority. 
  otherwise this becomes a monster jumble of stuffs that lose more and more clarity over time, as to what they are doing with each other.
