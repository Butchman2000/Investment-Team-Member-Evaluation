Abstract
We study the returns to investing in VIX futures, VIX Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and variance swaps. We document substantial negative return premia for these assets. For example, the constant maturity portfolio of 1-month VIX futures loses about 30% per year over our sample period (2006–2013). We investigate if these findings are consistent with dynamic equilibrium. We derive a model based on present value computation that endogenizes stock prices, the VIX index, and its associated derivative contracts. The model explains the negative return premia as well as several other stylized features of the VIX futures, ETNs, and variance swap data.
Introduction
In 2004, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Futures Exchange introduced cash settled futures contracts on the CBOE VIX volatility index. While initially sparsely traded, the VIX futures market has become very liquid in recent years. In addition to the futures market itself, since 2009, more than a dozen VIX futures Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) have been introduced, allowing retail investors to trade VIX futures through regular brokerage accounts. The ETNs follow simple, pre-specified, dynamic trading programs, and in most cases offer constant maturity exposure to n-month futures positions.
The interest in VIX futures and ETNs trading is due at least in part to the perceived positive diversification benefits of the contracts. The CBOE notes through various marketing materials that the VIX correlates negatively with the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 returns and therefore provides diversification benefits. The CBOE’s own estimates of the VIX-return correlation range from 
 to 
. Additionally, since the VIX is significantly more volatile than the S&P 500 itself, the VIX, and thus VIX futures, have substantial negative market betas.
The first objective of our paper is to provide descriptive statistics on the average returns to VIX futures positions and the associated ETNs. Szado (2009); Alexander and Korovilas (2012), and Whaley (2013) report negative annualized VIX futures returns. We collect futures data from January 2006 to May 2013 and confirm these findings. For example, if someone invested in VIX futures in January 2006 and rolled the position at end-of-day futures prices reported by the CBOE, she would have lost more than 97% of the initial investment by the end of March 2013. This corresponds to an annualized return of about 
. This number is staggering considering that during the first part of the sample period the investor would have more than doubled the initial investment through the peak of the 2008 financial crisis. Not surprisingly, the VIX ETNs perform as badly, if not worse, than the underlying futures. In fact, since the first two VIX ETNs were introduced on January 30, 2009, the VXX and VXZ, which offer exposure to short and medium term futures, respectively, have lost an average of 34 and 14 basis points per day (simple returns).
The second and major objective of our paper is to ask: are the negative average returns consistent with returns from a present value based equilibrium model? Specifically, we use the equilibrium model of Eraker and Wang (2015) to derive equilibrium VIX futures prices. This model is based on a dynamic present value framework where investors discount a distant cash flow using time-varying discount rates. We show that the model produces a sizable volatility risk premium. To understand where this premium is coming from, we detail the main ingredients of the model here.
The large negative return premium to volatility assets in our model is linked to the volatility feedback effect. The fact that volatility shocks and stock prices are strongly negatively correlated is well known, and many authors have suggested this is caused by a volatility feedback effect. For example, French et al. (1987) conclude “...we interpret this negative relation as evidence of a positive relation between risk premia and ex ante volatility.” Campbell (1991) suggests decomposing realized returns into revisions in expected cash flows and revisions in expected discount rates, or expected rates of return. Any model based on present value computation that has time-varying expected rates of return will, according to Campbell’s decomposition, have an endogenous negative correlation between shocks to expected returns and realized returns. Our model implies that expected returns are proportional to a time-varying variance factor. Shocks to this variance factor correlate negatively with returns and the magnitude of the correlation depends on the representative agent’s risk aversion.
A primary objective in our analysis is to fully endogenize this negative correlation. To see why this is important, note first that prices of volatility derivatives, such as VIX futures, depend positively on spot volatility. Since volatility negatively correlates with stock prices, volatility claims are negative beta assets. Since volatility claims have negative market beta it is useful to consider a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) style equilibrium: in order to deliver a large negative premium for volatility assets they would need to be negatively correlated with the market portfolio. Since the prices of volatility derivatives are positive increasing functions of spot market volatility, a key component in generating a negative risk premium is that spot volatility itself is negatively correlated with the market. Our model does this, and our baseline specification generates a volatility-return correlation of 
 at the estimated parameter values.
Both diffusive and jump shocks to cash flow volatility are priced in equilibrium and the market price of risk is a function of risk aversion and the “deep” parameters that govern the dynamics of volatility. Rather obviously, the market price of volatility risk depends on the parameters that govern the size of volatility shocks. Also, important to note, it is inversely related to the speed of volatility mean reversion. Intuitively, investors demand a higher risk compensation when shocks to volatility have a longer lasting effect. This is analogous to long run risk models.
The model generates an upward sloping equilibrium futures curve (contango) in steady-state. This means that, ceteris paribus, investors who purchase VIX futures pay more than the value of the spot VIX at expiration of the futures contract, on average. The equilibrium model produces a negative premium in all states of the world, whether or not the VIX is above or below its steady-state value. Even if the futures curve is in backwardation (downward sloping), the futures may imply a negative risk premium because the physical speed of mean reversion will be faster than the Q measure speed of mean reversion implicit in the futures prices. These pricing implications are entirely equilibrium outcomes. If the representative agent in the model is risk neutral, none of these pricing implications hold. In particular, there is no volatility risk premium, the steady-state futures curve is essentially flat, and the expected return on VIX futures is zero.
Our paper is connected to the extant literature in several ways. Our theoretical model is related to long run risk models (Bansal and Yaron, 2004) that deliver large volatility risk premia such as those of Eraker and Shaliastovich (2008) and Drechsler and Yaron (2011). Other theoretical justifications for large volatility risk premia include the heterogeneous beliefs model of Buraschi et al. (2014). Bollerslev et al. (2009); Andersen and Todorov (2013) among others show that the volatility risk premium can predict stock market returns. Eraker (2012) shows that a large volatility risk premium is consistent with large negative equity options returns such as those found empirically in Bondarenko (2003); Bakshi and Kapadia (2003), and Eraker (2013), among others. Broadie et al. (2007) conclude that jump-risk premium, not volatility risk premium, is the primary driver of risk premia in option returns. Recently, Andersen and Todorov (2013) proposed a model with a self-exciting jump process but find that this “tail factor” has no incremental power in predicting equity return above the level of volatility itself. This empirical finding lends support to the specification of models in which jump-risks are not disentangled from the diffusive variance, as in our model.
In our model, jump and volatility risk premia are obtained endogenously and both are increasing in the level of risk aversion. Simplified, if agents are risk averse, they care about the volatility of future cash flows. Their aversion toward high volatility is similar across diffusive and jump driven increments to volatility. Yet, the equilibrium price process we use has characteristics that are similar to existing reduced-form, no-arbitrage models. Our most general model has a two-factor volatility specification where jumps in the volatility endogenously lead to negative jumps in the equilibrium price. This is similar, but not identical to, the volatility co-jump models in Duffie et al. (2000); Eraker et al. (2003); Bandi and Reno (2012), and Andersen and Todorov (2013) where the correlations between volatility and prices are assumed.
While our paper, to our knowledge, is the first to attempt a structural explanation for the negative VIX futures return premium, several papers fit statistical models to futures prices and judge the resulting empirical model fit using root-mean-square error (RMSE) or other distance metrics based on the difference between the model and market prices. For example, Zhang and Zhu (2006) analyze the model fit based on Heston (1993), while (Lin, 2007) and (Zhu and Lian, 2012) analyze models in the more general class of Duffie et al. (2000). These papers generally conclude that models with more complicated volatility dynamics (i.e., jumps) produce better statistical fit. Egloff et al. (2010) find that the two-factor model of Bates (2000) outperforms Heston’s model. Some studies from related markets include Song (2012) who studies returns on VIX options. He finds that both diffusive volatility-of-volatility and volatility jumps are important in capturing VIX option returns. Carr and Wu (2006) study a sample of returns to variance-swap contracts. Their sample, collected from 1990 to 2005, contains strikingly large positive (negative) returns to sellers (buyers) of variance swaps.
In our empirical examination we first confirm the large negative returns to VIX futures reported elsewhere. We verify that the negative returns to futures translate into correspondingly negative returns to VIX ETNs that invest in long positions. The returns are particularly bad for short maturity futures and VIX ETNs. Yet, we show that our equilibrium model is generating returns that are almost identical to those we observe in our sample. In our empirical implementation, we first estimate our return equilibrium model. This is done using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, extending the method in Eraker et al. (2003) to a structural setting. The advantage of the structural model is that we estimate the risk aversion of the representative agent from returns data alone. We therefore recover the pricing kernel without the use of additional data from derivatives markets. This contrasts empirical studies of reduced-form, no-arbitrage models that simultaneously use derivatives and returns data to back out market risk prices, as in Pan (2002); Chernov and Ghysels (2000); Eraker (2004); Andersen and Todorov (2013), and Jackwerth and Vilkov (2014).
We show that the equilibrium model can explain the negative returns to VIX futures and VIX ETNs almost exactly. In particular, the model that includes volatility jumps fits all moments of maturities that are less than 4 months. For 4- and 5-month futures, the model underestimates the variability (standard deviation) of the futures returns. We argue that the model’s inability to account for the return standard deviation of longer maturity contracts is consistent with similar model failures in the affine term structure literature in capturing low frequency movements. We demonstrate that a generalized model that allows for a second volatility factor (i.e., a “central tendency” factor) can be calibrated such that all the moments of the VIX futures data are matched.
The rest of the paper is organized by the following. In the next section we present basic descriptive evidence on the returns to VIX futures contracts and VIX ETNs. Section 3 presents the equilibrium framework and structural parameter estimates. Section 4 presents our empirical evaluation of the model and compares it to data on VIX futures and VIX ETNs as well as variance swaps. Section 5 concludes.
Section snippets
VIX futures and ETN returns
In the following section we provide descriptive evidence of the statistical behavior of VIX futures and ETNs. We start with the futures. Before presenting the evidence, it is worthwhile noting that there are some subtle issues involved in measuring the average returns of VIX futures. In particular, the futures price, like the VIX itself, is extremely volatile. The return distribution also displays right skewness: as the VIX occasionally jumps, a long futures position provides a large positive
An equilibrium model of VIX futures
In the following section we outline an equilibrium framework to understand and analyze the returns to VIX futures, their ETNs, and variance swaps. Our model aims to explain how VIX futures earn high negative expected returns. We take a first pass at this by estimating the (negative) beta of the futures returns and see whether the CAPM can explain the returns. With a beta of 
 and a market risk premium of 5% to 7.5%, we end up at a return premium of 
 to 
 if we assume a zero risk free
Empirical analysis
We estimate the model using structural likelihood-based estimation. The estimation approach is similar to that of Eraker et al. (2003) (hereby EJP) in that we draw the parameters of the model from the posterior distribution 
 using MCMC sampling. The latent conditional variances, 
 the jump times, dNt, and jump sizes, ξt, are drawn from the respective conditional posterior distributions in a manner similar to that of EJP. The main difference is that our structural model leads to
Concluding remarks
In this paper we show that the average returns earned on volatility and variance derivatives are very negative. We argue that the negative returns are consistent with equilibrium. Though the size of the negative return premium is not consistent with a traditional CAPM, which delivers a risk premium of 
 per year, we show that our dynamic equilibrium models are capable of explaining the 
 per year average return to a 1-month (rolled) futures position. The SVVJ model, which includes
