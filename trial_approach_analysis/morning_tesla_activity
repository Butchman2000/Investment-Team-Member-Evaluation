Initial Blurb:

Morning dip and rips. such as tesla sometimes. dumps to 9:50 plus minus 5 minutes, heavier on the plus side. often has some resistance candles with long wicks down,
combined with strength and order flow, (or some normalized coeficient mixture) will often retrace some, and along the way the 3day to 10day(no longer) call options
gain several percet on the way back up, before theta and IV loss start to eat away at it beyond noon.

For this one we will need global contraints, defaults, #notes showing suggested ranges of 5 or 6 values, for later brute forcing with AI help (but not now!), and refactor everything, 
bringing it to the top, and/or a global util .py for all the variables that ML will use to learn and optimize, or for which a downvectored recursive NN can learn (but not now!).
