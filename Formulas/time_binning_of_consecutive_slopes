How to analyze the patterns of the day after market open.
In boxes of 3, 4, and 5 minute windows, no matter how many candles appear in them (they could all be missing, although I have
specific consequences later, that I explain in detail), from 0930 to 1030, there are to be specific analyses done on these windows.

At minimum, (if at least two points are available), we perform a linear regression to get slope, intercept, and r_squared.

For several points, we determine of the first or the last are of significant deviation, via analysis of the length of the periperpendicular
length of stock price at that minute, from the line of the linear regression.
this is calculated by height*sin^-1(angle_from_dropdown)... = tan ( 1/ slope)  [yes, i double checked]



For consecutive sets of 3 minutes, find slope, then assign to one of 7 gradient values
upwards (strongly, moderately, minimally), neutral, downwards (minimally, moderately, strongly)
4e, 3e, 2e, 1e,   0,   -1e, -2e, -3e, -4e
where e (epsilon) is a latter fitting artefact
if slope extreme either way, such as 1.5x above the (4) or (-4), then assign it a 'pump' or 'dump' value
3 # pumps are suspicious, especially consecutively
dumps are concerning if several in a row beyond 9:50 or 9:55

Note: will need to normalize slope values, first, with demanded defaults,
# that is, take a look at 20 days of them, and figure out slope ranges,
# then roughly assign slope value ranges (that is, what is the range of slopes for bin -3, as an example, perhaps -0.5 to -1.2, or something)

Later: full backtested binning

For sure, if, at minimum, 2 of the first 3 three-minute blocks, has negative slope,
then we are definitely watching for a retrace.
Note: later reward-weighted for best arrangements of slopes, wherein retracements occurred
