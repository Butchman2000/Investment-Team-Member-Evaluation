Risk management is the work of balancing opportunities for gains with the potential of making losses from your investing choices. This work can help reduce potential losses and increase potential gains. It can also help protect traders' accounts from losing all of their money. The risk of losing money occurs when traders open positions. The larger the positions, the greater the risk, but also the greater opportunity for profit.

Risk management is an essential but often overlooked prerequisite to successful active trading. After all, a trader who has generated substantial profits can lose it all in just one or two bad trades without a proper risk management strategy. So how do you develop the best techniques to curb the risks of the market?

This article will discuss some simple strategies that can be used to protect your trading profits.

Key Takeaways
Trading can be exciting and even profitable if you are able to stay focused, do due diligence, and keep emotions at bay.
Still, the best traders need to incorporate risk management practices to prevent losses from getting out of control.
Having a strategic and objective approach to cutting losses through stop orders, profit taking, and protective puts is a smart way to stay in the game.
Planning Your Trades
As Chinese military general Sun Tzu's famously said: "Every battle is won before it is fought." This phrase implies that planning and strategy—not the battles—win wars. Similarly, successful traders commonly quote the phrase: "Plan the trade and trade the plan." Just like in war, planning ahead can often mean the difference between success and failure.

First, make sure your broker is right for frequent trading. Some brokers cater to customers who trade infrequently. They charge high commissions and don't offer the right analytical tools for active traders.

Stop-loss (S/L) and take-profit (T/P) points represent two key ways in which traders can plan ahead when trading. Successful traders know what price they are willing to pay and at what price they are willing to sell. They can then measure the resulting returns against the probability of the stock hitting their goals. If the adjusted return is high enough, they execute the trade.

Conversely, unsuccessful traders often enter a trade without having any idea of the points at which they will sell at a profit or a loss. Like gamblers on a lucky—or unlucky—streak, emotions begin to take over and dictate their trades. Losses often provoke people to hold on and hope to make their money back, while profits can entice traders to imprudently hold on for even more gains.

Consider the One-Percent Rule
A lot of day traders follow what's called the one-percent rule. Basically, this rule of thumb suggests that you should never put more than 1% of your capital or your trading account into a single trade. So if you have $10,000 in your trading account, your position in any given instrument shouldn't be more than $100.

This strategy is common for traders who have accounts of less than $100,000—some even go as high as 2% if they can afford it. Many traders whose accounts have higher balances may choose to go with a lower percentage. That's because as the size of your account increases, so too does the position. The best way to keep your losses in check is to keep the rule below 2%—any more and you'll be risking a substantial amount of your trading account.

Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Points
A stop-loss point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a loss on the trade. This often happens when a trade does not pan out the way a trader hoped. The points are designed to prevent the "it will come back" mentality and limit losses before they escalate. For example, if a stock breaks below a key support level, traders often sell as soon as possible.

On the other hand, a take-profit point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a profit on the trade. This is when the additional upside is limited given the risks. For example, if a stock is approaching a key resistance level after a large move upward, traders may want to sell before a period of consolidation takes place.

How to More Effectively Set Stop-Loss Points
Setting stop-loss and take-profit points is often done using technical analysis, but fundamental analysis can also play a key role in timing. For example, if a trader is holding a stock ahead of earnings as excitement builds, they may want to sell before the news hits the market if expectations have become too high, regardless of whether the take-profit price has been hit.

Moving averages represent the most popular way to set these points, as they are easy to calculate and widely tracked by the market. Key moving averages include the 5-, 9-, 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day averages. These are best set by applying them to a stock's chart and determining whether the stock price has reacted to them in the past as either a support or resistance level.

Another great way to place stop-loss or take-profit levels is on support or resistance trend lines. These can be drawn by connecting previous highs or lows that occurred on significant, above-average volume. The key is determining levels at which the price reacts to the trend lines or moving averages and, of course, on high volume.

When setting these points, here are some key considerations:

Use longer-term moving averages for more volatile stocks to reduce the chance that a meaningless price swing will trigger a stop-loss order to be executed.
Adjust the moving averages to match target price ranges. For example, longer targets should use larger moving averages to reduce the number of signals generated.
Stop losses should not be closer than 1.5 times the current high-to-low range (volatility), as it is likely to get executed without reason.
Adjust the stop loss according to the market's volatility. If the stock price isn't moving too much, then the stop-loss points can be tightened.
Use known fundamental events such as earnings releases, as key time periods to be in or out of a trade as volatility and uncertainty can rise.
Calculating Expected Return
Setting stop-loss and take-profit points are also necessary to calculate the expected return. The importance of this calculation cannot be overstated, as it forces traders to think through their trades and rationalize them. It also gives them a systematic way to compare various trades and select only the most profitable ones.

This can be calculated using the following formula:

[(Probability of Gain) x (Take Profit % Gain)] + [(Probability of Loss) x (Stop-Loss % Loss)]

The result of this calculation is an expected return for the active trader, who will then measure it against other opportunities to determine which stocks to trade. The probability of gain or loss can be calculated by using historical breakouts and breakdowns from the support or resistance levels—or for experienced traders, by making an educated guess.

Diversify and Hedge
Making sure you make the most of your trading means never putting all your eggs in one basket. If you put all your money into one idea, you're setting yourself up for a big loss. Remember to diversify your investments—across both industry sector as well as market capitalization and geographic region. Not only does this help you manage your risk, but it also opens you up to more opportunities.

You may also find yourself needing to hedge your position. Consider a stock position when the results are due. You may consider taking the opposite position through options, which can help protect your position. When trading activity subsides, you can then unwind the hedge.

Downside Put Options
If you are approved for options trading, buying a downside put option, sometimes known as a protective put, can also be used as a hedge to stem losses from a trade that turns sour. A put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying stock at a specified priced at or before the option expires. Therefore, if you own XYZ stock for $100 and buy the six-month $80 put for $1.00 per option in premium, then you will be effectively stopped out from any price drop below $79 ($80 strike minus the $1 premium paid).

What Is Active Trading?
Active trading means regularly attempting to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. You’re not buying stocks for retirement. The goal is to hold them for a limited amount of time and try to profit from the trend. Active traders are named as such because are frequently in and out of the market.

What Are the Risk Management Techniques Used by Active Traders?
Techniques that active traders use to manage risk include finding the right broker, thinking before acting, setting stop-loss and take-profit points, spreading bets, diversifying, and hedging.

What Is the 1% Rule in Trading?
The 1% rule demands that traders never risk more than 1% of their total account value on a single trade. In a $10,000 account, that doesn’t mean you can only invest $100. It means you shouldn’t lose more than $100 on a single trade.

How Do I Become a Successful Active Trader?
To become a successful active trader you must understand financial markets and be familiar with the various tools used to read price movements. You must also have sufficient capital and time to trade and be capable of keeping your emotions in check. The key is having a strategy and sticking to it. And, if you want to be successful over the long term, spreading out your bets.

Active trading isn’t for everyone. Despite what you may hear, it isn’t easy and guaranteed to generate enough money for you to quit your day job. Think carefully, start small, and try simulating some trades on a test account before putting your money on the line.

The Bottom Line
Traders should always know when they plan to enter or exit a trade before they execute. By using stop losses effectively, a trader can minimize not only losses but also the number of times a trade is exited needlessly. In conclusion, make your battle plan ahead of time and keep a journal of your wins and losses.

Day Trading Introduction
What Is Market Risk?
Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will experience losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of investments in the financial markets. That is to say, it is risk of market price and interest rate movements.

Key Takeaways
Market risk, or systematic risk, affects the performance of the entire market simultaneously.
Market risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.
Specific risk, or unsystematic risk, involves the performance of a particular security and can be mitigated through diversification. 
Market risk may arise due to changes to interest rates, exchange rates, geopolitical events, or recessions.

Understanding Market Risk
Market risk and specific risk (unsystematic) make up the two major categories of investment risk. Market risk, also called systematic risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged in other ways. Sources of market risk include recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. Systematic risk, or market risk, tends to influence the entire market at the same time.

This can be contrasted with unsystematic risk, which is unique to a specific company or industry. Also known as nonsystematic risk, specific risk, diversifiable risk, or residual risk, in the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification.

Market risk exists because of price changes. The standard deviation of changes in the prices of stocks, currencies, or commodities is referred to as price volatility. Volatility is often presented in annualized terms and may be expressed as an absolute number, such as $10, or a percentage of the initial value, such as 10%.

Important
Publicly traded companies in the United States are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose how their productivity and results may be linked to the performance of the financial markets. This requirement is meant to detail a company’s exposure to financial risk.
1
 For example, a company providing derivative investments or foreign exchange futures may be more exposed to financial risk than companies that do not provide these types of investments. This information helps investors and traders make decisions based on their own risk management rules.

Other Types of Risk
In contrast to the market’s overall risk, specific risk or unsystematic risk is tied directly to the performance of a particular security and can be protected against through investment diversification. One example of unsystematic risk is a company declaring bankruptcy, thereby making its stock worthless to investors.

The most common types of market risks include interest rate risk, equity risk, currency risk, and commodity risk.

Interest rate risk covers the volatility that may accompany interest rate fluctuations due to fundamental factors, such as central bank announcements related to changes in monetary policy. This risk is most relevant to investments in fixed-income securities, such as bonds. 
Equity risk is the risk involved in the changing prices of stock investments.
Commodity risk covers the changing prices of commodities such as crude oil and corn.
Currency risk, or exchange-rate risk, arises from the change in the price of one currency in relation to another. Investors or firms holding assets in another country are subject to currency risk.
Managing Market Risk
If you are investing, there is no single way to completely avoid market risk. But you can use hedging strategies to protect against volatility and minimize the impact that market risk will have on your investments and overall financial health. For example, you can buy put options to protect against a downside move when targeting specific securities. Or, if you want to hedge a large portfolio of stocks, you can utilize index options.

Use a variety of these strategies to manage market risk and protect your portfolio.

Tip
Dollar-cost averaging won’t protect you against market risk. But investing the same amount of money on a regular schedule can help you ride out ups and downs in the market, taking advantage of periods of both low costs and high returns.

Study Currency Profiles
If you are investing in foreign markets, pay attention to the currency profiles of the companies in which you invest. Industries that import more, for example, will be impacted by changes to the local currency. Industries that export more will be affected by changes to the value of the euro or dollar. Allocate your assets across a variety of industries to mitigate risk, and invest in markets and companies backed by strong currencies.

Watch Interest Rates
To manage interest rate risk, pay attention to monetary policy and be prepared to shift your investments to account for interest rate changes. For example, if you are heavily invested in bonds and interest rates are rising, you may want to tweak your investments to focus on shorter-term bonds.

Maintain Liquidity
When markets are volatile, you may have trouble selling or buying an asset within your price range, especially when you need to exit a position in a hurry. If the market is crashing, liquidity may be difficult no matter what type of stocks you buy. Under more normal conditions, though, you can maintain your liquidity by sticking with stocks that have low impact cost (the cost of a transaction for that stock) to make trading easier.

Invest in Staples
Some industries tend to do well even when the overall economy is poor. These tend to be utilities and businesses producing consumer staples. That’s because no matter what the economy is doing, people still need to turn their lights on, still need to eat, and still need toilet paper and toothpaste. By keeping some of your money in staples, you can still see returns in a recession or a period of high unemployment.

Think Long Term
No matter where you invest your money, it is impossible to fully escape market risk and volatility. But you can manage this risk, and escape much of the impact of volatile markets, by using a long-term investing strategy. You may want to make small tweaks in response to changes in the market. But don’t upend your entire investing strategy because a recession hit or a currency changed value.

In general, short-term traders are more impacted by volatility. By contrast, over time, volatility tends to even out over time. By approaching your investing systematically, and sticking with a long-term outlook and strategy, you are more likely to see your portfolio bounce back from the impact of market risks.

Measuring Market Risk
To measure market risk, investors and analysts often use the value-at-risk (VaR) method. VaR modeling is a statistical risk management method that quantifies a stock’s or portfolio’s potential loss as well as the probability of that potential loss occurring. While well-known and widely utilized, the VaR method requires certain assumptions that limit its precision.

For example, it assumes that the makeup and content of the portfolio being measured are unchanged over a specified period. Though this may be acceptable for short-term horizons, it may provide less accurate measurements for long-term investments.

Value at Risk (VaR)
VaR is a statistical measure that calculates the maximum potential loss a portfolio could experience over a given time period at a certain level of confidence. So, a VaR of 95% suggests that there is a 95% chance that the portfolio would not lose more than the calculated amount over the given time period.

The historical method for computing VaR looks at one’s prior returns history and orders them from worst losses to greatest gains—following from the premise that past returns experience will inform future outcomes.
The variance-covariance method, also called the parametric method, does not look backward but instead assumes that gains and losses are normally distributed. Potential losses are framed in terms of the number of standard deviations from the mean.
Monte Carlo simulation uses computational models to simulate projected returns over hundreds or thousands of possible iterations. Then, it estimates the chances that a loss will occur to compute the VaR—say, what the maximum loss would be 5% of the time.
Risk Premium
The equity risk premium (ERP) is a measure of market risk that reflects the excess return that investors demand for investing in stocks over and above the risk-free rate of return. In other words, it is the implied additional compensation that investors require to hold an investment in the broader stock market, which is inherently riskier than holding a risk-free asset like U.S. Treasuries.

The ERP is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (usually the yield on a short-term or midterm government bond) from the expected return on the stock market. For example, if the expected return on the stock market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 2%, the ERP would be 8%.

The difference between the broader market risk premium (MRP) and the equity risk premium comes down to scope. The ERP is specific to the stock market, while the MRP is the additional return that’s expected on a diversified portfolio of investments held among various asset classes that is above the risk-free rate.

Fast Fact
Beta is another relevant risk metric that measures the relative volatility or market risk of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. It is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to calculate the expected return of an asset. A beta of 1.0 indicates a stock has market risk identical to the broader S&P 500, while a beta greater than 1 means that the asset is more volatile than the market. Beta can be used to estimate the market risk of a portfolio by calculating the weighted average beta of its constituent assets.

What’s the difference between market risk and specific risk?
Market risk and specific risk make up the two major categories of investment risk.

Market risk, also called systematic risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged in other ways and tends to influence the entire market at the same time.

Specific risk, in contrast, is unique to a specific company or industry. Specific risk, also known as unsystematic risk, diversifiable risk or residual risk, can be reduced through diversification.

What are some types of market risk?
The most common types of market risk include interest rate risk, equity risk, commodity risk, and currency risk.

Interest rate risk covers the volatility that may accompany interest rate fluctuations and is most relevant to fixed-income investments.

Equity risk is the risk involved in the changing prices of stock investments.

Commodity risk covers the changing prices of commodities such as crude oil and corn.

Currency risk, or exchange-rate risk, arises from the change in the price of one currency in relation to another. This may affect investors holding assets in another country.

How is market risk measured?
A widely used measure of market risk is the value-at-risk (VaR) method. VaR modeling is a statistical risk management method that quantifies a stock’s or portfolio’s potential loss as well as the probability of that potential loss occurring. While well-known, the VaR method requires certain assumptions that limit its precision.

Beta is another relevant risk metric that measures the relative sensitivity of an asset to broader market movements. The equity risk premium (ERP) is the implied expected return that investors demand while holding market risk in the stock market, above and beyond that of the risk-free rate of return.

Is inflation a market risk?
Inflation can contribute to market risk by impacting business performance, consumer behavior, and investor confidence. Monetary policy may be used to counter inflation through higher interest rates, which can in turn lead to a recession, causing the entire market to slow down.

This is different from inflationary risk, or the possibility that the rising prices caused by inflation could outpace the returns from your investment.

Inflationary risk is not a specific type of market risk because it doesn’t impact the overall performance of financial markets. However, it is a type of investing risk. Diversification, investing early to take advantage of compound interest, and investing more aggressively when you are younger can all help minimize inflationary risk.

The Bottom Line
Market risk is the chance of incurring losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of financial markets. Events such as changes in interest rates, geopolitical events, or recessions can bring on what is known as the pain trade. It is called systematic risk since it cannot be eliminated through diversification. Specific risk, on the other hand, is unique to a particular stock or industry sector and can be minimized through diversification.

Market risk can be measured using methods such as the value-at-risk (VaR) method, risk premium, or beta coefficient.

Being a winning trader over the long haul is a function of your winning percentage and the size of your wins and losses. Regardless of how often you win, you could blow up your account if you don't control your risk. Traders risk losing money on every single trade—even the most successful ones make losing trades all the time.

A proper risk management strategy protects traders from catastrophic losses. This means determining your risk appetite, knowing your risk-reward ratio on every trade, and taking steps to protect yourself from a long-tail risk or black swan event.

Key Takeaways
Losing money is an inherent part of trading.
Surviving trading risks means minimizing losses.
Risk management in trading begins with developing a trading strategy that accounts for the win-loss percentage and the averages of the wins and losses.
Avoiding catastrophic losses is crucial.
Following a rational trading strategy and keeping emotion out of trading decisions is vital to success.
Understanding Common Risk Management Strategies
There is no way to avoid risk in trading. Every single trade could, theoretically end up a loser. For instance:

A successful trader can lose money on trades more often than they make money and can still end up ahead in the long run if the size of their gains on winning trades far exceeds the losses on their losers.
Another trader can make money on a majority of their trades and still lose money over time by taking small gains on their winners and letting losing trades run too long.
The first key to risk management in trading is determining your trading strategy's win-loss ratio and the average size of your wins and losses. If you know these numbers and they add up to long-term profitability, you are well on your way to successful trading. If you don't, you are putting your trading account at risk.

Minimizing Losses
According to legendary trader Ed Seykota, there are three rules to successful trading, and each one is to "cut your losses."
1
 One common rule of thumb, particularly for day traders, is never to risk losing more than 1% of your portfolio on any single trade. That way, you can suffer a string of losses—always a risk, given the random distribution of results—and not do too much damage to your portfolio.
2
CME Group Education. "Controlling Risk."


A 10% drawdown on a trading account can be overcome with a profitable trading strategy. But the bigger the drawdown, the more challenging it is to bounce back. If you lose 10% of your capital, you only need a gain of 11.1% to get to breakeven. But if you lose 50%, you'll need to double your money just to get back to even.

In addition to limiting the size of your position, one way to avoid big losses is to place automatic stop-loss orders. These will be executed once your loss reaches a certain level, saving you the difficult chore of pressing the button on a loss.

Important
Minimizing losses is often the most vital part of any trading strategy.

Rules Keep Emotions out of Trading Decisions
Managing emotions is the most difficult part of trading. It is a truism in the trading world that a successful trader can give their system to a rookie, and the rookie will end up losing all of their money because they can't keep emotion out of the trades. That means they can't take the losses when the trading system says get out, and they can't take the wins either—because they want to hold on for bigger gains.

That's why adopting a proven trading strategy and following the specific rules determined by that strategy are vital to success. Get into the trade when the system tells you to, and get out the same way. Don't second-guess the system.

What Are the Primary Types of Risk Management in Trading?
Risk management primarily involves minimizing potential losses without sacrificing upside potential. This is often borne out in the risk/reward ratio, a type of cost-benefit analysis based on the expected returns of an investment compared to the amount of risk taken on to earn those returns.

Hedging strategies are another type of risk management, which involves the use of offsetting positions, such as protective puts, that make money when the primary investment experiences losses. A third strategy is to set trading limits such as stop-losses to automatically exit positions that fall too low, or take-profit orders to capture gains.

How Is Diversification a Risk Management Strategy for Investors?
Portfolio diversification is a strategy of owning non-correlated assets so that overall risk is reduced without sacrificing expected returns. Mathematically, this combination of assets results in a portfolio that should fall close to the efficient frontier, which is elaborated on in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

What Are Some Examples of Risk Mitigation?
Insurance is an example of risk mitigation. Here, a risk is taken on by some third party in return for economic compensation. So a car insurance company receives policy premiums from drivers but agrees to pay out to compensate for damage or injury incurred in a covered car accident.

In financial markets, credit default swaps (CDS) operate similarly, whereby one financial institution receives premium payments to insure another financial institution against a credit event in some other company or investment. Risk avoidance is another mitigation strategy that tries to prevent being exposed to a risk scenario completely.

The Bottom Line
Losses are inevitable in trading, even if you're a winning trader. That's why risk management is so important. Using strategies to manage and minimize your risk can turn things around for you. One of the best things to do is to ensure that you've practiced your trading strategy and mastered it to the best of your ability.

Planning Your Trades
As Chinese military general Sun Tzu's famously said: "Every battle is won before it is fought." This phrase implies that planning and strategy—not the battles—win wars. Similarly, successful traders commonly quote the phrase: "Plan the trade and trade the plan." Just like in war, planning ahead can often mean the difference between success and failure.

They can then measure the resulting returns against the probability of the stock hitting their goals. If the adjusted return is high enough, they execute the trade.

Losses often provoke people to hold on and hope to make their money back, while profits can entice traders to imprudently hold on for even more gains.

Consider the One-Percent Rule
A lot of day traders follow what's called the one-percent rule. Basically, this rule of thumb suggests that you should never put more than 1% of your capital or your trading account into a single trade. So if you have $10,000 in your trading account, your position in any given instrument shouldn't be more than $100.

This strategy is common for traders who have accounts of less than $100,000—some even go as high as 2% if they can afford it. Many traders whose accounts have higher balances may choose to go with a lower percentage. That's because as the size of your account increases, so too does the position. The best way to keep your losses in check is to keep the rule below 2%—any more and you'll be risking a substantial amount of your trading account.

Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Points
A stop-loss point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a loss on the trade. This often happens when a trade does not pan out the way a trader hoped. The points are designed to prevent the "it will come back" mentality and limit losses before they escalate. For example, if a stock breaks below a key support level, traders often sell as soon as possible.

On the other hand, a take-profit point is the price at which a trader will sell a stock and take a profit on the trade. This is when the additional upside is limited given the risks. For example, if a stock is approaching a key resistance level after a large move upward, traders may want to sell before a period of consolidation takes place.

How to More Effectively Set Stop-Loss Points
Setting stop-loss and take-profit points is often done using technical analysis, but fundamental analysis can also play a key role in timing. For example, if a trader is holding a stock ahead of earnings as excitement builds, they may want to sell before the news hits the market if expectations have become too high, regardless of whether the take-profit price has been hit.

Moving averages represent the most popular way to set these points, as they are easy to calculate and widely tracked by the market. Key moving averages include the 5-, 9-, 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day averages. These are best set by applying them to a stock's chart and determining whether the stock price has reacted to them in the past as either a support or resistance level.

Another great way to place stop-loss or take-profit levels is on support or resistance trend lines. These can be drawn by connecting previous highs or lows that occurred on significant, above-average volume. The key is determining levels at which the price reacts to the trend lines or moving averages and, of course, on high volume.

When setting these points, here are some key considerations:

Use longer-term moving averages for more volatile stocks to reduce the chance that a meaningless price swing will trigger a stop-loss order to be executed.
Adjust the moving averages to match target price ranges. For example, longer targets should use larger moving averages to reduce the number of signals generated.
Stop losses should not be closer than 1.5 times the current high-to-low range (volatility), as it is likely to get executed without reason.
Adjust the stop loss according to the market's volatility. If the stock price isn't moving too much, then the stop-loss points can be tightened.
Use known fundamental events such as earnings releases, as key time periods to be in or out of a trade as volatility and uncertainty can rise.
Calculating Expected Return
Setting stop-loss and take-profit points are also necessary to calculate the expected return. The importance of this calculation cannot be overstated, as it forces traders to think through their trades and rationalize them. It also gives them a systematic way to compare various trades and select only the most profitable ones.

This can be calculated using the following formula:

[(Probability of Gain) x (Take Profit % Gain)] + [(Probability of Loss) x (Stop-Loss % Loss)]

The result of this calculation is an expected return for the active trader, who will then measure it against other opportunities to determine which stocks to trade. The probability of gain or loss can be calculated by using historical breakouts and breakdowns from the support or resistance levels—or for experienced traders, by making an educated guess.

Diversify and Hedge
Making sure you make the most of your trading means never putting all your eggs in one basket. If you put all your money into one idea, you're setting yourself up for a big loss. Remember to diversify your investments—across both industry sector as well as market capitalization and geographic region. Not only does this help you manage your risk, but it also opens you up to more opportunities.

You may also find yourself needing to hedge your position. Consider a stock position when the results are due. You may consider taking the opposite position through options, which can help protect your position. When trading activity subsides, you can then unwind the hedge.

Downside Put Options
If you are approved for options trading, buying a downside put option, sometimes known as a protective put, can also be used as a hedge to stem losses from a trade that turns sour. A put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying stock at a specified priced at or before the option expires. Therefore, if you own XYZ stock for $100 and buy the six-month $80 put for $1.00 per option in premium, then you will be effectively stopped out from any price drop below $79 ($80 strike minus the $1 premium paid).

What Is Active Trading?
Active trading means regularly attempting to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. You’re not buying stocks for retirement. The goal is to hold them for a limited amount of time and try to profit from the trend. Active traders are named as such because are frequently in and out of the market.

What Are the Risk Management Techniques Used by Active Traders?
Techniques that active traders use to manage risk include finding the right broker, thinking before acting, setting stop-loss and take-profit points, spreading bets, diversifying, and hedging.

What Is the 1% Rule in Trading?
The 1% rule demands that traders never risk more than 1% of their total account value on a single trade. In a $10,000 account, that doesn’t mean you can only invest $100. It means you shouldn’t lose more than $100 on a single trade.

How Do I Become a Successful Active Trader?
To become a successful active trader you must understand financial markets and be familiar with the various tools used to read price movements. You must also have sufficient capital and time to trade and be capable of keeping your emotions in check. The key is having a strategy and sticking to it. And, if you want to be successful over the long term, spreading out your bets.

Active trading isn’t for everyone. Despite what you may hear, it isn’t easy and guaranteed to generate enough money for you to quit your day job. Think carefully, start small, and try simulating some trades on a test account before putting your money on the line.

The Bottom Line
Traders should always know when they plan to enter or exit a trade before they execute. By using stop losses effectively, a trader can minimize not only losses but also the number of times a trade is exited needlessly. In conclusion, make your battle plan ahead of time and keep a journal of your wins and losses.

Risk/Reward Ratio

What Is the Risk/Reward Ratio?
The risk/reward ratio—also known as the risk/return ratio—marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns. A lower risk/return ratio is often preferable as it signals less risk for an equivalent potential gain.

Consider the following example: an investment with a risk-reward ratio of 1:7 suggests that an investor is willing to risk $1, for the prospect of earning $7. Alternatively, a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 signals that an investor should expect to invest $1, for the prospect of earning $3 on their investment.

Traders often use this approach to plan which trades to take, and the ratio is calculated by dividing the amount a trader stands to lose if the price of an asset moves in an unexpected direction (the risk) by the amount of profit the trader expects to have made when the position is closed (the reward).

Key Takeaways
The risk/reward ratio is used by traders and investors to manage their capital and risk of loss.
The ratio helps assess the expected return and risk of a given trade.
In general, the greater the risk, the greater the expected return demanded.
An appropriate risk reward ratio tends to be anything greater than 1:3.
How the Risk/Reward Ratio Works
In many cases, market strategists find the ideal risk/reward ratio for their investments to be approximately 1:3, or three units of expected return for every one unit of additional risk. Investors can manage risk/reward more directly through the use of stop-loss orders and derivatives such as put options.

The risk/reward ratio is often used as a measure when trading individual stocks. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs widely among various trading strategies. Some trial-and-error methods are usually required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy, and many investors have a pre-specified risk/reward ratio for their investments.

Note that the risk/return ratio can be computed as one's personal risk tolerance on an investment, or as the objective calculation of an investment's risk/return profile. In the latter case, expected return is often used in the denominator and potential loss in the numerator. Expected return can be computed in several ways, including projecting historical returns into the future, estimating the weighted probabilities of future outcomes, or using a model like the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

To estimate the potential loss, investors may use a variety of methods, such as analyzing historical price data with technical analysis, using the historical standard deviation of price action, assessing company financial statements with fundamental analysis, and models like value-at-risk (VaR). These methods can help investors identify factors that could impact the investment's value and estimate the potential downside.

Tip
Estimating the expected return and potential loss is not an exact science, and the actual amount of risk and return may differ from your estimates. Investors should also consider their own risk tolerance when evaluating the potential risk of an investment, as the amount of risk they are willing to take on can vary depending on their personal circumstances and investment goals.

What Does the Risk/Reward Ratio Tell You?
The risk/reward ratio helps investors manage their risk of losing money on trades. Even if a trader has some profitable trades, they will lose money over time if their win rate is below 50%. The risk/reward ratio measures the difference between a trade entry point to a stop-loss and a sell or take-profit order. Comparing these two provides the ratio of profit to loss, or reward to risk.

Investors often use stop-loss orders when trading individual stocks to help minimize losses and directly manage their investments with a risk/reward focus. A stop-loss order is a trading trigger placed on a stock that automates the selling of the stock from a portfolio if the stock reaches a specified low. Investors can automatically set stop-loss orders through brokerage accounts and typically do not require exorbitant additional trading costs.

Important
When the risk/return ratio is abnormally low, it could suggest that the potential gain is disproportionately large relative to the potential risk, which may indicate that the investment is riskier than it might appear. This is why some investors may approach investments with very low risk/return ratios with caution, as a low ratio alone does not guarantee a good investment.

Example of the Risk/Reward Ratio in Use
Consider this example: A trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company at $20 and places a stop-loss order at $15 to ensure that losses will not exceed $500. Also, assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to risk $5 per share to make an expected return of $10 per share after closing the position. Since the trader stands to make double the amount that they have risked, they would be said to have a 1:2 risk/reward ratio on that particular trade. Derivatives contracts such as put contracts, which give their owners the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified price, can be used to similar effect.

If an investor prefers to seek a 1:5 risk/reward ratio for a specified investment (five units of expected return for each additional unit of risk), then they can modify the stop-loss order and thus adjust the risk/reward ratio. But it is important to understand that by doing so the investor has changed the probability of success in their trade.

In the trading example noted above, suppose an investor set a stop-loss order at $18, instead of $15, and they continued to target a $30 profit-taking exit. By doing so they would certainly reduce the size of the potential loss (assuming no change to the number of shares), but they will have increased the likelihood that the price action will trigger their stop loss order. That's because the stop order is proportionally much closer to the entry than the target price is. So although the investor may stand to make a proportionally larger gain (compared to the potential loss), they have a lower probability of receiving this outcome.

How Do You Calculate the Risk/Return Ratio?
To calculate the risk/return ratio (also known as the risk-reward ratio), you need to divide the amount you stand to lose if your investment does not perform as expected (the risk) by the amount you stand to gain if it does (the reward).

The formula for the risk/return ratio is:

Risk/Return Ratio = Potential Loss / Potential Gain

Why Is the Risk/Return Ratio Important?
The risk/return ratio helps investors assess whether a potential investment is worth making. A lower ratio means that the potential reward is greater than the potential risk, while a high ratio means the opposite. By understanding the risk/return ratio, investors can make more informed decisions about their investments and manage their risk more effectively.

Can the Risk/Return Ratio of an Investment Change Over Time?
Yes, the risk/return ratio can change over time as the investment's price moves its potential risk changes. For example, if a stock's price goes up, the potential reward may become less than when it was initially purchased, while the potential risk may have also increased.

It's important to regularly monitor the risk/return ratio of your investments and adjust your portfolio accordingly to ensure that your investments align with your goals and risk tolerance.



The Bottom Line
The risk-reward ratio is a measure of potential profit to potential loss for a given investment or project. A lower risk-reward ratio is generally preferable because it offers the potential for a greater return on investment without undue risk-taking. A ratio that is too high indicates that an investment could be overly risky. However, a ratio that is too low should be met with suspicion. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals when determining the appropriate ratio for their portfolio. Diversifying investments, the use of protective put options, and using stop-loss orders can help optimize your risk-return profile.
