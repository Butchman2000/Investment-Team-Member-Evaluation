Initial Blurb:

Morning dip and rips. such as tesla sometimes. dumps to 9:50 plus minus 5 minutes, heavier on the plus side. often has some
resistance candles with long wicks down, combined with strength and order flow, (or some normalized coeficient mixture)
will often retrace some, and along the way the 3day to 10day(no longer) call options gain several percet on the way back up,
before theta and IV loss start to eat away at it beyond noon.

For this one we will need global contraints, defaults, #notes showing suggested ranges of 5 or 6 values, for later brute 
forcing with AI help (but not now!), and refactor everything, bringing it to the top, and/or a global util .py for all
the variables that ML will use to learn and optimize, or for which a downvectored recursive NN can learn (but not now!).

For a variety of reasons, there are stocks that move in a fashion such that:

Premise 1: There exists typical behaviors of stocks, that in part, are attributable to how investment swims among support and resistance,
/technical patterns, retracement behaviors, mean reversion, and other single-stock-focused analysis.

Premise 2: Separately, there is a manifold of effects, displayed in price action, for stocks like tesla, wherein causes can be postulated.
Utilization f Premise 2: (to be determined)

Premise 3: There exists causes, some of which can be explored, by themselves, or together, that can assist in attaining higher
  /predictive robustness, then only looking at the specifics of premise one alone.
Utilization of Premise 3: (to be determined)

Premise 4: There are stocks who sympathetically move in response to movements to tesla:
  4a:  Stocks who are in the same sector, and
    4a1:  move sympathetically in roughly the same time region (perhaps 0 to 1 hour)
    4a2:  move sympathetically in a lagged time frame (1 hour to [1day+2hrs]) 
  4b: Stocks who are not in the same sector, and still
    4b1: move sympathetically...
    4b2: ...
Utilizaiton of Premise 4: (to be determined)

Premise 5: There is to be observed such, that Tesla price movement, slightly before and after the morning bell, that tesla drops
/in price, due to:
  5a. large funds and hedges are selling to capture their alpha to that point
  5b. retail and investment house stop losses are triggered, which drives price forther down
  5c. symmetric selling behavior continues as the order flow in support of buying, thins out or is withdrawn
  5d. other reasons (insert more here if discovered)
Utilization of Premise 5: (to be determined)

Premise 6: There is to be observed such, more often than other (mid-cap) or (large-cap) or (mid- and large-cap) stocks,
/in a time period around 0945 to 1030, that tesla sometimes experiences significant retracement.
Utilization of Premise 6: (to be determined)

Premise 7: Therein exists a situation, of higher propability of success versus random entry in first two morning hours, such that
/alpha is available, due to price movement or call price increase.
Utility of Premise 7: (PROFIT POTENTIAL, see '...' below)

Premise 8: There often exists, near the relative bottom of price movement, a selection of candles that indicate support, resistance to
/orders being filled any further lower, which is seen as lower wicks in several candles near one another.
  8a.  Sometimes, a range of one minute candles, between 3 to 8 minutes in time, encompass the necessary information to
  /indicate that retracement is going to occur.
  8b.  Sometimes, the total size of the candle has grown smaller in that region, as if the sell stops and other depleting causes
  /have reached their final exhaustion, and buyers are returning, and fill orders are being placed.
Utilization of Premise 8: (to be determined)

Premise 9: ...

# Whether you continue in this fashion, as additional .py files, or extend this file with demarcation, like sseen below,
# we navigate ideas necessary for a mental model of the scenario, sufficient to encapsulate all necessary considerations of
# what would need to be considered, for a model to be worthy of drafting.  As the bin allotment may eventually approach $250.000,
# herein lies the critical parameterization and interdependent model explanation sufficient to justify risk-on approaches regardless of
# market conditions.  BEWARE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WARNINGS AT THE BEGINNING.  THERE IS ZERO ROOM FOR BREAKING THOSE RULES.
