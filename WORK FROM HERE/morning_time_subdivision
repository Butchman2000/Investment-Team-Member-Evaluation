### This portion is a more technical breakdown of time slices and how they are to be treated
and what connection they have to the bigger picture in terms of analysis of opportunity.
Most other conversations do not need this level of technical proficiency.
It is moreso a chance to 

#If the time periods of the morning activities, are divided into 5 minute segments,
then between 0930 and 1015, there is 9 (5-minute) segments
this demands that we consider activity in 5,10,15 minute blocks of blocks,
have modeling ideas that operate in blocks, in blocks of blocks (my team will leave that for ML)
and brute force ranges of variables to check best fitment, unless the combinatorics are so large that other attempts will be made

anyway, if we designate [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] as the first derivative range of values 
which is correlated against 'slope' and we normalize slope in the beginning of the morning, from open until bottom or something,
then we can hve 

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I

wherein each of A-I can be -3 to 3, as intervals

(difficulty in assumption here, though, as standardized 'slope' default value is dictated via ML from before somehow)
(each day may be slightly different, and market conditions would dictate how we assume 'slope' to be, or would require)
(a 'slope_modifier' value, dependent on things like fear/greed index, index movement, and inverse VIX movement relationship)

FEAR/GREED    INDEX (SPY) movement    VIX movement
very fear      trend down             climbing
fear           drift down             drifting up
neutral        neutral                neutral
greed          drift up               drifting down
very greed     strong up              dropping

Eventually, the slope_modifier = sqrt( F*(fear/greed)^2 + I*(index_behavior)^2 + V*(1/(delta_VIX))^2)
or something similar.
If that does not fit well, then iterative exploration of partial differentials is in order, though it has been a long time
since I worked with calc and matrices and differential equations.
